Welcome! I am a Phd candidate in
[School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn), 
[the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). 



Research Interest
===
+ Distributed optimization
+ Federated learning, machine learning

Recent News
===
+ Feb. 2024: Our paper, [An Accelerated Distributed Stochastic Gradient Method with Momentum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09714) (with Shi Pu and Angelia NediÄ‡), is online. In this paper, a simple modification of DSGT leads to vast improvement.
+ Dec. 2023: I won the Duan Yong Ping Meritorious Research Award and received the Guotai Junan Securities Scholarship at CUHK-shenzhen.
+ Aug. 2023: I gave a short talk about our recent results on distributed stochastic gradient methods at the mini symposium of [ICIAM 2023](https://iciam2023.org/). 
+ Aug. 2023: I passed the thesis proposal and became a PhD candidate!
